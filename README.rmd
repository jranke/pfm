## Installation

You can install the package from [github](http://github.com/jranke/pfm), e.g.
using the `devtools` package.  Using `quick = TRUE` skips docs,
multiple-architecture builds, demos, and vignettes, to make installation as
fast and painless as possible.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("jranke/pfm", subdir = "pkg", quick = TRUE)
```
