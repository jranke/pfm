#' Calculate initial predicted environmental concentrations in surface water due to drainage using the UK method
#'
#' This implements the method specified in the UK data requirements handbook and was checked against the spreadsheet
#' published on the CRC website
#'
#' @param rate Application rate in g/ha
#' @param interception The fraction of the application rate that does not reach the soil
#' @param Koc The sorption coefficient normalised to organic carbon in L/kg
#' @param latest_application Latest application date, formatted as e.g. "01 July"
#' @param soil_DT50 Soil degradation half-life, if SFO kinetics are to be used
#' @param model The degradation model to be used. Either one of "FOMC", "DFOP", 
#'   "HS", or "IORE", or an mkinmod object
#' @param model_parms A named numeric vector containing the model parameters
#' @return The predicted concentration in surface water in Âµg/L
