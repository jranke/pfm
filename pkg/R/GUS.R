#' Groundwater ubiquity score based on Gustafson (1989)
#' 
#' The groundwater ubiquity score GUS is calculated according to
#' the following equation
#' \deqn{GUS = \log_10 DT50_{soil} (4 - \log_10 K_{oc}}{GUS = log10 DT50soil * (4 - log10 Koc)}
#' 
#' @references Gustafson, David I. (1989) Groundwater ubiquity score: a simple
#' method for assessing pesticide leachability. _Environmental
#' toxicology and chemistry_ *8*(4) 339â€“57.
#' @inheritParams endpoint
#' @param chent If a chent is given with appropriate information present in its
#'   chyaml field, this information is used, with defaults specified below.
#' @param DT50 Half-life of the chemical in soil. Should be a field
#'   half-life according to Gustafson (1989). However, leaching to the sub-soil
#'   can not completely be excluded in field dissipation experiments and Gustafson
#'   did not refer to any normalisation procedure, but says the field study should
#'   be conducted under use conditions.
#' @param Koc The sorption constant normalised to organic carbon. Gustafson
#'   does not mention the nonlinearity of the sorption constant commonly
#'   found and usually described by Freundlich sorption, therefore it is 
#'   unclear at which reference concentration the Koc should be observed
#'   (and if the reference concentration would be in soil or in porewater).
#' @param lab_field Should laboratory or field half-lives be used? This
#'   defaults to lab in this implementation, in order to avoid
#'   double-accounting for mobility. If comparability with the original GUS
#'   values given by Gustafson (1989) is desired, non-normalised first-order
#'   field half-lives obtained under actual use conditions should be used.
#' @param degradation_value Which of the available degradation values should 
#'   be used?
#' @param sorption_value Which of the available sorption values should be used?
#'   Defaults to Kfoc as this is what is generally available from the European
#'   pesticide peer review process. These values generally use a reference
#'   concentration of 1 mg/L in porewater, that means they would be expected to
#'   be Koc values at a concentration of 1 mg/L in the water phase.
#' @param degradation_aggregator Function for aggregating half-lives
#' @param sorption_aggregator Function for aggregation Koc values
#' @return A list with the DT50 and Koc used as well as the resulting score
#'   of class GUS_result
