      * Description : Example project 1
      * Substance   : Dummy compound H_sw

      * Remarks : SWASH report helps you to set up the needed runs to
      *           calculate the PECsw and PECsed, occuring in the EU
      *           for the selected substance, used on the selected crop.
      *           The scenario code informs you which models you need to
      *           run for this scenario.
      *           D1-D6: drainage entries calculated by the MACRO model,
      *                  fate in surface water calculated by the TOXSWA model
      *           R1-R4: runoff and erosion entries calculated by the PRZM model,
      *                  fate in surface water calculated by the TOXSWA model
      *
      *      N.B. For STREAMS the Mean Deposition and Mass Loading, as calculated
      *           by the FOCUS Drift Calculator, have been multiplied by a factor
      *           1.2 to account for pesticide mass incoming from the upstream
      *           catchment as decided by the FOCUS Surface Water Scenarios Working
      *           Group.
