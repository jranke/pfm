\title{Retrieve endpoint information from the chyaml field of a chent object}
\usage{
endpoint(chent, medium = "soil", type = c("degradation", "sorption"),
  lab_field = c(NA, "laboratory", "field"), redox = c(NA, "aerobic",
  "anaerobic"), value = c("DT50ref", "Kfoc", "N"), aggregator = geomean,
  raw = FALSE, signif = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{chent}{The \code{\link{chent}} object to get the information from}

\item{medium}{The medium for which information is sought}

\item{type}{The information type}

\item{lab_field}{If not NA, do we want laboratory or field endpoints}

\item{redox}{If not NA, are we looking for aerobic or anaerobic data}

\item{value}{The name of the value we want. The list given in the 
usage section is not exclusive}

\item{aggregator}{The aggregator function. Can be mean, 
\code{\link{geomean}}, or identity, for example.}

\item{signif}{How many significant digits do we want}
}
\value{
The result from applying the aggregator function to
  the values converted to a numeric vector, rounded to the
  given number of significant digits, or, if raw = TRUE,
  the values as a character value, retaining any implicit
  information on precision that may be present.

\description{
R6 class objects of class \code{\link{chent}} represent chemical entities
and can hold a list of information loaded from a chemical yaml file in their
chyaml field. Such information is extracted and optionally aggregated by
this function.
