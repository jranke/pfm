\title{Plot TOXSWA surface water concentrations}
\usage{
\method{plot}{TOXSWA_cwa}(x, time_column = c("datetime", "t", "t_firstjan"),
  xlab = "default", ylab = "default", add = FALSE, total = FALSE,
  LC_TIME = "C", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The TOXSWA_cwa object to be plotted.}

\item{time_column}{What should be used for the time axis. If "t_firstjan" is chosen,
the time is given in days relative to the first of January in the first year.}

\item{xlab,ylab}{Labels for x and y axis.}

\item{add}{Should we add to an existing plot?}

\item{total}{Should the total concentration in water be plotted, including substance sorbed
to suspended matter?}

\item{LC_TIME}{Specification of the locale used to format dates}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to \code{plot} if we are not adding to an existing plot}
}
\description{
Plot TOXSWA hourly concentrations of a chemical substance in a specific
segment of a segment of a TOXSWA surface water body.
