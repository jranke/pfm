\title{Read TOXSWA surface water concentrations}
\usage{
read.TOXSWA_cwa(filename, basedir = ".", zipfile = NULL, segment = "last",
  total = FALSE, windows = NULL, thresholds = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{The filename of the cwa file (TOXSWA 2.x.y  or similar) or the
out file (FOCUS TOXSWA 4, i.e. TOXSWA 4.4.2 or similar).}

\item{basedir}{The path to the directory where the cwa file resides.}

\item{zipfile}{Optional path to a zip file containing the cwa file.}

\item{segment}{The segment for which the data should be read. Either "last", or 
the segment number.}

\item{total}{Set this to TRUE in order to read total concentrations as well. This is 
only necessary for .out files as generated by TOXSWA 4.4.2 or similar, not for .cwa
files. For .cwa files, the total concentration is always read as well.}

\item{windows}{Numeric vector of width of moving windows in days, for calculating
maximum time weighted average concentrations and areas under the curve.}

\item{thresholds}{Numeric vector of threshold concentrations in Âµg/L for
generating event statistics.}
}
\value{
An instance of an R6 object of class
\code{\link{TOXSWA_cwa}}.

\description{
Read TOXSWA hourly concentrations of a chemical substance in a specific
segment of a TOXSWA surface water body. Per default, the data for the last
segment are imported. As TOXSWA reports the values at the end of the hour
(ConLiqWatLayCur) in its summary file, we use this value as well instead
of the hourly averages (ConLiqWatLay).
