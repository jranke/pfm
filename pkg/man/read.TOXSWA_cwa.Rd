\title{Read TOXSWA surface water concentrations}
\usage{

  windows = NULL, thresholds = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{The filename of the cwa file.}

\item{basedir}{The path to the directory where the cwa file resides.}

\item{zipfile}{Optional path to a zip file containing the cwa file.}

\item{segment}{The segment for which the data should be read. Either "last", or
the segment number.}

\item{windows}{Numeric vector of width of moving windows in days, for calculating
maximum time weighted average concentrations and areas under the curve.}

\item{thresholds}{Numeric vector of threshold concentrations in Âµg/L for
generating event statistics.}
}
\value{
An instance of an R6 object of class
\code{\link{TOXSWA_cwa}}.
}
\description{
Read TOXSWA hourly concentrations of a chemical substance in a specific
segment of a TOXSWA surface water body. Per default, the data for the last
segment are imported.
