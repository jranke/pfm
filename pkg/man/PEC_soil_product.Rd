\title{Calculate predicted environmental concentrations in soil for a product}
\usage{
PEC_soil_product(product, rate, rate_units = "L/ha", interception = 0,
  mixing_depth = 5, tillage_depth = 20, interval = 365,
  bulk_density = 1.5, PEC_units = "mg/kg")
}
\arguments{
\item{product}{An object of class pp}

\item{rate}{Application rate in units specified below}

\item{rate_units}{Defaults to g/ha}

\item{interception}{The fraction of the application rate that does not reach the soil}

\item{mixing_depth}{Mixing depth in cm}

\item{tillage_depth}{Periodic (see interval) deeper mixing in cm}

\item{interval}{Period of the deeper mixing, defaults to 365, which is a year if
rate units are in days}

\item{bulk_density}{Bulk density of the soil. Defaults to 1.5 kg/L, or 1500 kg/m3}

\item{PEC_units}{Requested units for the calculated PEC. Only mg/kg currently supported}
}
\value{
A data frame with compound names, and initial, plateau maximum, plateau minimum (background)
  and long term maximum predicted concentrations in soil
}
\description{
Calculates long term accumulation PEC values
