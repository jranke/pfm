\title{Calculate initial predicted environmental concentrations in surface water due to drift}
\usage{
PEC_sw_drift_ini(rate, applications = 1, water_depth = 30,
  drift_data = "JKI", crop = "Ackerbau", distances = c(1, 5, 10, 20),
  rate_units = "g/ha", PEC_units = "µg/L")
}
\arguments{
\item{rate}{Application rate in units specified below}

\item{applications}{Number of applications for selection of drift percentile}

\item{water_depth}{Depth of the water body in cm}

\item{drift_data}{Source of drift percentage data}

\item{crop}{Crop name (use German names for JKI data), defaults to "Ackerbau"}

\item{distances}{The distances in m for which to get PEC values}

\item{rate_units}{Defaults to g/ha}

\item{PEC_units}{Requested units for the calculated PEC. Only µg/L currently supported}
}
\value{
The predicted concentration in surface water
}
\description{
This is a basic, vectorised form of a simple calculation of a contaminant
concentration in surface water based on complete, instantaneous mixing
with input via spray drift.
