\title{Calculate predicted environmental concentrations in soil}
\usage{
PEC_soil(rate, rate_units = "g/ha", interception = 0, mixing_depth = 5,
  bulk_density = 1.5, PEC_units = "mg/kg")
}
\arguments{
\item{rate}{Application rate in units specified below}

\item{rate_units}{Defaults to g/ha}

\item{interception}{The fraction of the application rate that does not reach the soil}

\item{mixing_depth}{Mixing depth in cm}

\item{bulk_density}{Bulk density of the soil. Defaults to 1.5 kg/L, or 1500 kg/m3}

\item{PEC_units}{Requested units for the calculated PEC. Only mg/kg currently supported}
}
\value{
The predicted concentration in soil
}
\description{
This is a basic, vectorised form of a simple calculation of a contaminant
concentration in bulk soil based on complete, instantaneous mixing.
}
\examples{
PEC_soil(100, interception = 0.25)
