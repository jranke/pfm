\title{Calculate FOCUS Step 1 PEC surface water}
\usage{
PEC_sw_focus(parent, rate, n = 1, i = NA, applications = data.frame(time =
  seq(0, 0 + n * i, length.out = n), amount = rate), met = NULL, step = 1,
  f_drift = 0.02759, f_rd = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{parent}{A list containing substance specific parameters}

\item{rate}{The application rate in g/ha. Overriden when
applications are given explicitly}

\item{n}{The number of applications}

\item{i}{The application interval}

\item{applications}{A dataframe containing times and amounts of each application}

\item{step}{At the moment, only Step 1 is implemented}
}
\description{
This is an attempt to reimplement the FOCUS Step 1 and 2 calculator authored
by Michael Klein. The Step 1 and 2 scenario assumes an area ratio of 10:1
between field and waterbody, and a water depth of 30 cm.
I did not (yet) implement the TWA formulas for times later than day 1, as I
did not understand them right away.
Also, Step 2 is not implemented (yet).

dummy_1 <- chent_focus_sw(cwsat = 6000, DT50_ws = 6, Koc = 344.8)
