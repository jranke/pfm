\title{Properties of the predefined scenarios from the EFSA guidance from 2015}
\format{
A data frame with one row for each scenario. Row names are the scenario codes, 
  e.g. CTN for the Northern scenario for the total concentration in soil. Columns are 
  mostly self-explanatory. \code{rho} is the dry bulk density of the top soil.
