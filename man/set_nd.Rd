\title{Set non-detects in residue series without replicates}
\usage{
set_nd(r, lod, loq = NA, time_zero = TRUE, time_zero_nd_value = NA,
  stop_after_first_nondetect = FALSE)

set_nd_focus(r, lod, loq = NA, time_zero = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{r}{A character vector of sequential residues without replicates, with
non-detects specified as 'nd' and unquantified values above the limit of
detection specified as 'nq', otherwise coercible to numeric}

\item{lod}{Limit of detection (numeric)}

\item{loq}{Limit of quantification(numeric). Must be specified if the FOCUS rule to
stop after the first non-detection is to be applied}

\item{time_zero}{Is the first value in the series a time zero value?}

\item{time_zero_nd_value}{Which value should we use for non-detects at time zero?}

\item{stop_after_first_nondetect}{Should we really stop after the first non-detection?}
}
\description{
Sets non-detects directly before or directly after detects to NA. Values between
lod and loq are set to their mean value if an loq is specified.
If 'time_zero' is set to TRUE, the residue series is assumed to start with time
zero, and non-detects at time zero are set to 'time_zero_nd_value'. For the
set_nd_focus variant, this is zero, otherwise this argument has NA as default
value.
If stopping after the first non-detection is requested, as in in the FOCUS
variant of the function, an loq has to be specified in order to decide
if any later detections are above the loq.
