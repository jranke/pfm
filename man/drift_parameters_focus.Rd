\usage{
drift_parameters_focus
}
\description{
The parameters were extracted from Appendix B to the FOCUS surface water guidance
using the R code given in the file \code{data_generation/drift_parameters_focus.R}
installed with this package. The appendix itself is not included in the package,
as its licence is not clear.
}
\details{
For the hinge distance, \code{Inf} was substituted for the cases where no hinge
distance is given in the data, in this way parameters C and D are never
used for any distance if A and B are used for the case that the distance
is smaller than the hinge distance.
