\title{R6 class for holding TOXSWA cwa concentration data and associated statistics}
\format{An \code{\link{R6Class}} generator object.}
\usage{
TOXSWA_cwa
}
\description{
An R6 class for holding TOXSWA cwa concentration data and some associated statistics.
Usually, an instance of this class will be generated by \code{\link{read.TOXSWA_cwa}}.
}
\section{Fields}{

\describe{
\item{\code{filename}}{Length one character vector.}

\item{\code{basedir}}{Length one character vector.}

\item{\code{segment}}{Length one integer, specifying for which segment the cwa data were read.}

\item{\code{cwas}}{Dataframe holding the concentrations.}

\item{\code{events}}{List of dataframes holding the event statistics for each threshold.}

\item{\code{windows}}{Matrix of maximum time weighted average concentrations (TWAC_max)
and areas under the curve in µg/day * h (AUC_max_h) or µg/day * d (AUC_max_d) 
for the requested moving window sizes in days.}
}}

\section{Methods}{

\describe{
  \item{\code{get_events(threshold, total = FALSE)}}{
        Populate a datataframe with event information for the specified threshold value
        in µg/L. If \code{total = TRUE}, the total concentration including the amount
        adsorbed to suspended matter will be used. The resulting dataframe is stored in the 
        \code{events} field of the object.
        }
  \item{\code{moving_windows(windows, total = FALSE)}}{
        Add to the \code{windows} field described above.
        Again, if \code{total = TRUE}, the total concentration including the amount
        adsorbed to suspended matter will be used.
        }
