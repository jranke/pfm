\title{Properties of the predefined scenarios from the EFSA guidance from 2017}
\format{A data frame with one row for each scenario. Row names are the scenario codes, 
  e.g. CTN for the Northern scenario for the total concentration in soil. Columns are 
  mostly self-explanatory. \code{rho} is the dry bulk density of the top soil.}

Properties of the predefined scenarios used at Tier 1, Tier 2A and Tier 3A for the 
concentration in soil as given in the EFSA guidance (2017, p. 14/15). Also, the
