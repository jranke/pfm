\arguments{
\item{rate}{Application rate in units specified below}

\item{applications}{Number of applications for selection of drift percentile}

\item{water_depth}{Depth of the water body in cm}

\item{drift_percentages}{Percentage drift values for which to calculate PECsw.
'drift_data' and 'distances' if not NULL.}

\item{drift_data}{Source of drift percentage data. If 'JKI', the \link{drift_data_JKI}
included in the package is used. If 'RF', the Rautmann formula is used, if
implemented for the crop type and number of applications}

\item{crop_group_JKI}{When using the 'JKI' drift data, one of the German names
as used in \link{drift_parameters_focus}.}

\item{crop_group_focus}{One of the crop groups as used in \link{drift_parameters_focus}}

\item{distances}{The distances in m for which to get PEC values}

\item{rate_units}{Defaults to g/ha}

\item{PEC_units}{Requested units for the calculated PEC. Only µg/L currently supported}
}
\value{
The predicted concentration in surface water
}
\description{
This is a basic, vectorised form of a simple calculation of a contaminant
concentration in surface water based on complete, instantaneous mixing
with input via spray drift.

\examples{
PEC_sw_drift(100)
# Alternatively, we can use the formula for a single application to "Ackerbau" from the paper
PEC_sw_drift(100, drift_data = "RF")

# This makes it possible to also use different distances
PEC_sw_drift(100, distances = c(1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 20, 50, 100), drift_data = "RF")

# or consider aerial application
PEC_sw_drift(100, distances = c(1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 20, 50, 100), drift_data = "RF", 
  crop_group_focus = "aerial")

# Using custom drift percentages is also supported
PEC_sw_drift(100, drift_percentages = c(2.77, 0.95, 0.57, 0.48, 0.29, 0.15, 0.06, 0.03))
