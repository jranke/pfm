\description{
A named character vector with the crop names used in the PELMO 5.5.3 GUI.
For the names, three letter codes were constructed by generally taking the
first three letters in lower case. Only when there is an expression in 
parentheses, the first letter of this expression becomes the first letter 
in the three letter code, i.e. 'Peas (animals)' has the code \code{ape}.
