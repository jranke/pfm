\title{Set up runs for FOCUS PELMO}
\usage{
PELMO_runs(runs, psm_dir = ".", version = "5.5.3", PELMO_base = "auto",
  execute = TRUE, cores = getOption("mc.cores", 2L), evaluate = TRUE,
  overwrite = FALSE)

run_PELMO(runs, version = "5.5.3", PELMO_base = "auto",
  cores = getOption("mc.cores", 2L))

evaluate_PELMO(runs, version = "5.5.3", PELMO_base = "auto")
}
\arguments{
\item{runs}{A list of lists. Each inner lists has an element named 'psm'
that holds the psm string, and elements named using three letter crop acronyms,
as used in \code{\link{FOCUS_PELMO_crops}},
that hold character vectors of three letter scenario acronyms
as used in \code{\link{FOCUS_GW_scenarios_2012}}.}

\item{psm_dir}{The directory where the psm files are located}

\item{version}{The FOCUS PELMO version}

\item{PELMO_base}{Where the FOCUS PELMO installation is located}

\item{execute}{Should PELMO be executed directly?}

\item{cores}{The number of cores to execute PELMO runs in parallel}

\item{evaluate}{Should the results be returned?}

\item{overwrite}{Should an existing run directories be overwritten}
}
\description{
Per default, the runs are not only set up but also executed with FOCUS
PELMO, the results are processed and returned. Currently, only FOCUS PELMO
as installed on Linux (or other Unix systems)
using the \code{\link{install_PELMO}} from the \code{PELMO.installeR} package
maintained on github is supported. In such installations, FOCUS PELMO is
installed into the package installation directory of \code{PELMO.installeR}
and run using \code{wine}.
