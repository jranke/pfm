\title{Calculate initial predicted environmental concentrations in surface water due to drainage using the UK method}
\usage{
PEC_sw_drainage_UK(
  rate,
  interception = 0,
  Koc,
  latest_application = NULL,
  soil_DT50 = NULL,
  model = NULL,
  model_parms = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rate}{Application rate in g/ha}

\item{interception}{The fraction of the application rate that does not reach the soil}

\item{Koc}{The sorption coefficient normalised to organic carbon in L/kg}

\item{latest_application}{Latest application date, formatted as e.g. "01 July"}

\item{soil_DT50}{Soil degradation half-life, if SFO kinetics are to be used}

\item{model}{The soil degradation model to be used. Either one of "FOMC",
"DFOP", "HS", or "IORE", or an mkinmod object}

\item{model_parms}{A named numeric vector containing the model parameters}
}
\value{
The predicted concentration in surface water in Âµg/L
}
\description{
This implements the method specified in the UK data requirements handbook and was checked against the spreadsheet
published on the CRC website
