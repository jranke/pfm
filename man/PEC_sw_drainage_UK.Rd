\title{Calculate initial predicted environmental concentrations in surface water due to drainage using the UK method}
\usage{
PEC_sw_drainage_UK(
  rate,
  interception = 0,
  Koc,
  latest_application = NULL,
  soil_DT50 = NULL,
  model = NULL,
  model_parms = NULL
)

drainage_date_UK(application_date)
}
\arguments{
\item{rate}{Application rate in g/ha or with a compatible unit specified
with the units package}

\item{interception}{The fraction of the application rate that does not reach the soil}

\item{Koc}{The sorption coefficient normalised to organic carbon in L/kg or a unit specified
with the units package}

\item{latest_application}{Latest application date, formatted as e.g. "01 July"}

\item{soil_DT50}{Soil degradation half-life, if SFO kinetics are to be used, in
days or a time unit specified with the units package}

\item{model}{The soil degradation model to be used. Either one of "FOMC",
"DFOP", "HS", or "IORE", or an mkinmod object}

\item{model_parms}{A named numeric vector containing the model parameters}

\item{application_date}{Application date}
}
\value{
The predicted concentration in surface water in µg/L
}
\description{
This implements the method specified in the UK data requirements handbook and was checked against the spreadsheet
published on the CRC website. Degradation between the end (30 April) and the start (1 October) of
the drainage period is taken into account if
\code{latest_application} is specified and the degradation parameters are given either as a \code{soil_DT50} or a \code{model}.
