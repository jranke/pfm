Deposition from spray drift expressed as percent of the applied dose as
published by the German Julius-Kühn Institute (JKI).

\details{
The data were extracted from the spreadsheet cited below using the R code
given in the example section. The spreadsheet is not included in the package
as its licence is not clear.

Additional spray drift values were taken from the publication by Rautmann
et al. (2001). Specifically, these are the values for early vines, and
the values for a 3 m buffer which are incomplete in the spreadsheet.

Note that for vegetables, ornamentals and small fruit, the values for
field crops are used for crops < 50 cm, and the vales for late vines are
used for crops > 50 cm. In the JKI spreadsheet, it is indicated that
these values are used for spray applications with handheld/knapsack
equipment (tragbare Spritz- und Sprühgerate).

Values for non-professional use listed in the JKI spreadsheet were not
included.
