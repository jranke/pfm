\title{The maximum time weighted average concentration for a moving window}
\usage{
max_twa(x, window = 21)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of type \code{\link{one_box}}}

\item{window}{The size of the moving window}
}
\description{
If you generate your time series using \code{\link{sawtooth}},
you need to make sure that the length of the time series allows
for finding the maximum. It is therefore recommended to check this using
\code{\link{plot.one_box}} using the window size for the argument
\code{max_twa}.
}
\details{
The method working directly on fitted \code{\link{mkinfit}} objects uses the
equations given in the PEC soil section of the FOCUS guidance and is restricted
SFO, FOMC and DFOP models and to the parent compound
}
\examples{
pred <- sawtooth(one_box(10),
  applications = data.frame(time = c(0, 7), amount = c(1, 1)))
max_twa(pred)
pred_FOMC <- mkinfit("FOMC", FOCUS_2006_C, quiet = TRUE)
max_twa(pred_FOMC)
