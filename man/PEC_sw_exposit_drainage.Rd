Excel 3.02 spreadsheet available from

\usage{
PEC_sw_exposit_drainage(
  rate,
  interception = 0,
  Koc = NA,
  mobility = c(NA, "low", "high"),
  DT50 = Inf,
  t_drainage = 3,
  V_ditch = 30,
  V_drainage = c(spring = 10, autumn = 100),
  dilution = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rate}{The application rate in g/ha}

\item{interception}{The fraction intercepted by the crop}

\item{Koc}{The sorption coefficient to soil organic carbon used to determine the mobility. A trigger
value of 550 L/kg is used in order to decide if Koc >> 500.}

\item{mobility}{Overrides what is determined from the Koc.}

\item{DT50}{The soil half-life in days}

\item{t_drainage}{The time between application and the drainage event, where degradation occurs, in days}

\item{V_ditch}{The volume of the ditch is assumed to be 1 m * 100 m * 30 cm = 30 m3}

\item{V_drainage}{The drainage volume, equivalent to 1 mm precipitation on 1 ha for spring/summer or 10 mm for
autumn/winter/early spring.}

\item{dilution}{The dilution factor}
}
\value{
A list containing the following components
  \describe{
    \item{perc_runoff}{The runoff percentages for dissolved and bound substance}
    \item{runoff}{A matrix containing dissolved and bound input for the different distances}
    \item{PEC_sw_runoff}{A matrix containing PEC values for dissolved and bound substance
      for the different distances. If the rate was given in g/ha, the PECsw are in microg/L.}
  }
}
\description{
This is a reimplementation of the calculation described in the Exposit 3.02 spreadsheet file,
in the worksheet "Konzept Drainage". Although there are four groups of
compounds ("Gef√§hrdungsgruppen"), only one distinction is made in the
calculations, between compounds with low mobility (group 1) and compounds
with modest to high mobility (groups 2, 3 and 4). In this implementation,
the group is derived only from the Koc, if not given explicitly. For
details, see the discussion of the function arguments below.
