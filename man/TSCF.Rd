\title{Estimation of the transpiration stream concentration factor}
\usage{
TSCF(log_Kow, method = c("briggs82", "dettenmaier09"))
}
\arguments{
\item{log_Kow}{The decadic logarithm of the octanol-water partition constant}

\item{method}{Short name of the estimation method.}
}
\description{
The FOCUS groundwater guidance (FOCUS 2014, p. 41) states that a reliable measured
log Kow for neutral pH must be available in order to apply the Briggs
equation. It is not clarified when it can be regarded reliable, but the
equation is stated to be produced for non-ionic compounds, suggesting that
the compound should not be ionogenic (weak acid/base)
or ionic.
}
\details{
The Dettenmaier equation is given to show that other views on the subject exist.
