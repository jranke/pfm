\title{Calculate drift percentages based on Rautmann data}
\usage{
drift_percentages_rautmann(
  distances,
  applications = 1,
  crop_group_RF = c("arable", "hops", "vines, late", "vines, early", "fruit, late",
    "fruit, early", "aerial"),
  formula = c("Rautmann", "FOCUS"),
  widths = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{distances}{The distances in m for which to get PEC values}

\item{applications}{Number of applications for selection of drift percentile}

\item{crop_group_RF}{One of the crop groups as used in \link{drift_parameters_focus}}

\item{formula}{By default, the original Rautmann formula is used. If you
specify "FOCUS", mean drift input over the width of the water body is
calculated as described in Chapter 5.4.5 of the FOCUS surface water guidance}

\item{widths}{The widths of the water bodies (only used in the FOCUS formula)}
