#' Properties of the predefined scenarios used at Tier 1, Tier 2A and Tier 3A for the 
#' concentration in soil as given in the EFSA guidance (2015, p. 13/14). Also, the 
#' scenario and model adjustment factors from p. 15 and p. 17 are included.

#' @docType data
#' @format A data frame with one row for each scenario. Row names are the scenario codes, 
#'   e.g. CTN for the Northern scenario for the total concentration in soil. Columns are 
#'   mostly self-explanatory. \code{rho} is the dry bulk density of the top soil.
