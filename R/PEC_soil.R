#' Calculate predicted environmental concentrations in soil
#'
#' This is a basic calculation of a contaminant concentration in bulk soil
#' based on complete, instantaneous mixing. If an interval is given, an
#' attempt is made at calculating a long term maximum concentration using
#' the concepts layed out in the PPR panel opinion (EFSA PPR panel 2012
#' and in the EFSA guidance on PEC soil calculations (EFSA, 2015, 2017).
#'
#' This assumes that the complete load to soil during the time specified by
#' 'interval' (typically 365 days) is dosed at once. As in the PPR panel
#' opinion cited below (EFSA PPR panel 2012), only temperature correction using the
#' Arrhenius equation is performed.
#'
#' Total soil and porewater PEC values for the scenarios as defined in the EFSA
#' guidance (2017, p. 14/15) can easily be calculated.
#' @note While time weighted average (TWA) concentrations given in the examples
#' from the EFSA guidance from 2015 (p. 80) are be reproduced, this is not
#' true for the TWA concentrations given for the same example in the EFSA guidance
#' from 2017 (p. 92).
#' @note According to the EFSA guidance (EFSA, 2017, p. 43), leaching should be
#'   taken into account for the EFSA 2017 scenarios, using the evaluation depth
#'   (here mixing depth) as the depth of the layer from which leaching takes
#'   place.  However, as the amount leaching below the evaluation depth
#'   (often 5 cm) will partly be mixed back during tillage, the default in this function 
#'   is to use the tillage depth for the calculation of the leaching rate.
#' @note If temperature information is available in the selected scenarios, as
#'   e.g. in the EFSA scenarios, the DT50 for groundwater modelling
#'   (destination 'PECgw') is taken from the chent object, otherwise the DT50
#'   with destination 'PECsoil'.
#' @importFrom methods is
#' @param rate Application rate in units specified below
#' @param rate_units Defaults to g/ha
#' @param interception The fraction of the application rate that does not reach the soil
#' @param mixing_depth Mixing depth in cm
#' @param interval Period of the deeper mixing, defaults to 365, which is a year if
#'   degradation rate units are in days
#' @param n_periods Number of periods to be considered for long term PEC calculations
#' @param PEC_units Requested units for the calculated PEC. Only mg/kg currently supported
#' @param PEC_pw_units Only mg/L currently supported
#' @param tillage_depth Periodic (see interval) deeper mixing in cm
#' @param leaching_depth EFSA (2017) uses the mixing depth (ecotoxicological
#'   evaluation depth) to calculate leaching for annual crops where tillage
#'   takes place. By default, losses from the layer down to the tillage 
#'   depth are taken into account in this implementation.
#' @param cultivation Does mechanical cultivation in the sense of EFSA (2017)
#'   take place, i.e. twice a year to a depth of 5 cm? Ignored for scenarios
#'   other than EFSA_2017
#' @param crop Ignored for scenarios other than EFSA_2017. Only annual crops
#' are supported when these scenarios are used. Only crops with a single cropping
#' cycle per year are currently supported.
#' @param chent An optional chent object holding substance specific information. Can
#'   also be a name for the substance as a character string
#' @param DT50 If specified, overrides soil DT50 endpoints from a chent object
#'   If DT50 is not specified here and not available from the chent object, zero
#'   degradation is assumed
#' @param Koc If specified, overrides Koc endpoints from a chent object
#' @param Kom Calculated from Koc by default, but can explicitly be specified
#'   as Kom here
#' @param t_avg Averaging times for time weighted average concentrations
#' @param scenarios If this is 'default', the DT50 will be used without correction
#'   and soil properties as specified in the REACH guidance (R.16, Table
#'   R.16-9) are used for porewater PEC calculations.  If this is "EFSA_2015",
#'   the DT50 is taken to be a modelling half-life at 20Â°C and pF2 (for when
#'   'chents' is specified, the DegT50 with destination 'PECgw' will be used),
#'   and corrected using an Arrhenius activation energy of 65.4 kJ/mol. Also
#'   model and scenario adjustment factors from the EFSA guidance are used.
#' @param leaching Should leaching be taken into account? The default is FALSE,
#'   except when the EFSA_2017 scenarios are used.
#' @param porewater Should equilibrium porewater concentrations be estimated
#'   based on Kom and the organic carbon fraction of the soil instead of total
#'   soil concentrations?  Based on equation (7) given in the PPR panel opinion
#'   (EFSA 2012, p. 24) and the scenarios specified in the EFSA guidance (2015,
#'   p. 13).
