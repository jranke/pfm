The R package **pfm** provides some utilities for dealing with FOCUS pesticide fate modelling tools,
(currently only TOXSWA cwa and out files), made available under the GNU public license.

## Installation

You can install the package from [github](http://github.com/jranke/pfm), e.g.
using the `devtools` package.  Using `quick = TRUE` skips docs,
multiple-architecture builds, demos, and vignettes, to make installation as
fast and painless as possible.


```r
library(devtools)
install_github("jranke/pfm", subdir = "pkg", quick = TRUE)
```

## Use

### Analyse TOXSWA output

Read in and analyse a cwa file:



```r
library(pfm, quietly = TRUE)
```

```
## 
## Initialize Python Version 2.7.9 (default, Jun 29 2016, 13:11:10) 
## [GCC 4.9.2]
```

```r
example_cwa <- read.TOXSWA_cwa("00003s_pa.cwa")
plot(example_cwa)
```

<img src="README_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" />

Get events above thresholds of 20 and 100 Âµg/L,
and do a moving window analysis for windows of 7 days
and 21 days, print the results:


```r
example_cwa$get_events(c(20, 100))
example_cwa$moving_windows(c(7, 21))
print(example_cwa)
```

```

This can also be done with out files, the function reads
out files from current TOXSWA versions as well as cwa files
from old TOXSWA versions.


### Calculate PEC soil

Simple PEC soil calculation for an application rate of 100 g/ha and
25% interception, assuming complete mixing into 5 cm and a soil bulk
density of 1.5 kg/L, output in mg/kg:



```r
PEC_soil(100, interception = 0.25)
```

```
##      scenario
## t_avg default
##     0     0.1
```

### Rautmann drift data

Some of the drift percentage data published by the JKI are included. To
see the data for one application:



```r
drift_data_JKI[1]
```

### PEC surface water due to drift

Initial PEC values for an application of 100 g/ha in the vicinity of a 30 cm
deep water body are obtained using



```r
PEC_sw_drift(100, applications = 1)
```

```
##        1 m        5 m       10 m       20 m
